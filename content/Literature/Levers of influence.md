Levers of influence are natural phenomena in animals and humans that can be exploited by others to influence choice-making. They have the ability to let someone make a choice that they normally wouldn't choose.

There are two main levers of influence:
1. [[Fixed-action patterns]]
2. [[Perceptual contrast]]
