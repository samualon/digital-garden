We know what traits and what skills are needed to become an entrepreneur, but what incentivizes a person to actually start as an entrepreneur?

*Economics of Entrepreneurship* study this question.
# Drug dealing and entrepreneurship
## Paper by Fairly
[[Drug Dealing and Legitimate Self-Employment]] by [[Robert W. Fairly]] uses drug dealing as a proxy for three traits common to entrepreneurs:
- Entrepreneurial ability / generalist skills ([[Entrepreneurship by Lazear]])
- Preference for autonomy / non-pecuniary benefits ([[Does Entrepreneurship Pay by Hamilton|Paper by Hamilton]])
- Risk attitude

He found that having dealt drugs increases chances of becoming an entrepreneur later on, thus these traits (which are common in drug dealers) increase chances of becoming an entrepreneur.
## Alternative explanation
Some people that become entrepreneurs are forced to make this choice, [[Pushed entrepreneur|pushed entrepreneurship]]. They might have few options on the labor market.

Furthermore, drug dealers might have it easier in starting a business if they have lots of drug money.
## Impact of incentives
Entrepreneurs as people can end up in three situations:
- **Productive**: beneficial impact on society (increased income and employment)
- **Unproductive**: negative impact on society (tax evasion)
- **Destructive**: negative impact on society (organized crime)

The *rules of the game*, or environment of these entrepreneurs impacts where in the three categories they'll end up.
# Risk-return hypothesis
[[Does Entrepreneurship Pay by Hamilton]] tells us that entrepreneurship would break the risk-return hypothesis. Even though entrepreneurship doesn't pay more than paid employment, people still choose entrepreneurship. 

Why do entrepreneurs still choose self-employment even though the break of this risk-return hypothesis?

Four main explanations:
1. Investment and agency models
2. Matching and Learning models
3. Superstar theory
4. Non-pecuniary incentive

## Investment and agency models
### Investment
Investment models say that self-employment earnings are steeper, initially earnings are lower but will be higher after a while.
### Agency
Agency models say that earnings for paid employment increase steeper, to discourage shirking (not committing to work). This growth is an incentive to stick to the current paid employment.
## Matching and Learning models
### Matching
People that choose self-employment might be of lower quality than paid workers. In that way entrepreneurship selects lower quality people.
### Learning
Unexperienced workers might first choose paid employment, but notice a mismatch with their work and later on choose for self-employment (vise versa). Self-employment earnings might thus increase with self-employed experience.
## Superstar theory
Paid employment is capped, but self-employment isn't. Thus some self-employed might have very high earnings, which makes it such that the mean earnings of this group is higher than paid employees on average.
### Non pecuniary benefits
Self-employed choose this because of non pecuniary benefits, such as being able to work for yourself.

Self-employed are often also more satisfied with their work, have more flexibility and task variety.

People value not only the output utility (earnings), but also the utility of the conditions that they have to work under to get this output, the procedural utility. This is an intrinsic motivation to be self-employed.
