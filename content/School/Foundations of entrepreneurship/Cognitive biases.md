# Behavioral exit delay
Overconfident entrepreneurs often delay the exit of an underperforming venture. There are two influences for this cognitive bias:
1. Strength of prior beliefs
2. Updating of prior beliefs
## Strength of prior beliefs
Three components:
- [[Perceptual contrast|Anchoring]]
- [[Status quo bias]]
- [[Overconfidence]]
## Updating of prior beliefs
Three mechanism imply asymmetric updating, the placing of more weight on positive signals than negative signals:
- [[Self-serving bias]]
- [[Confirmation bias]]
- [[Motivated reasoning]]
## Other cognitive biases
- [[Over-optimism]]
- [[Illusion of control]]
- [[Case-based reasoning]]
