# Abstract
The paper explores the difference in decision-making between managers and entrepreneurs.

It is found that entrepreneurs rely more on biases and heuristics than managers in big businesses. There are two biases/heuristics:
- **Overconfidence**: overestimating the probability of being right.
- **Representativeness**: overgeneralize from only few characteristics or observations.

Since entrepreneurs are in uncertain environments, these biases can help them in making decisions since otherwise:
- would take to much time (closed [[Window of opportunity]])
- analyzing decision is too complex.

In this way the decision-making can be done approximately.

This type of decision-making is often present in context of innovation.
