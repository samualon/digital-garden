![[Causation and effectuation.png]]

Managers often thing casual. They try to achieve pre-determined goals by choosing means.

Entrepreneurs on the other hand imagine possible ends by using the means given. 
## Principles
There are five principles to [[Effectuation]]:
1. Bird-in-hands
2. Affordable loss
3. Crazy quilt
4. Lemonade
5. Pilot-in-the-plane
### Bird-in-hands
Effectual entrepreneurs start with what they have to determine what they can do:
- Who they are
- What they know
- Who they know

In contrast, casual managers assemble their means to achieve a pre-set goal.
### Affordable loss
Effectual entrepreneurs limit their risk by understanding what they can lose at every step of the process. **Don't risk more than they can lose.**

In contrast, casual managers make decisions based on expected return, then select the highest return and try to minimize risk. **Find most return and minimize what they can lose.**
### Crazy quilt
> The setting up of strategic partners.

Effectual entrepreneurs search for strategic partners to co-create with at the start of their venture. They build a future together with these customers, suppliers and sometimes competitors. **Build future with partners.**

Casual managers do a [[Competitive analysis]]. They focus on getting a competitive advantage instead of thinking about using competitors and partners to build on the future. **Purely transactional partnerships.**
### Lemonade
> The leveraging contingencies.

Effectual entrepreneurs see surprises as potential for new opportunities. They try to leverage surprises.

Casual managers try to completely avoid surprises.
### Pilot-in-the-plane
Effectual entrepreneurs believe they can *make* the future by focusing on activities within their control. **They co-create.**

Casual managers believe in inevitable trends and try to predict the future instead of making it. **They plan.**
## Critique
- Very new
- Rivalry is under-specified even though competition is very important.
- Lack of directionality
- Very optimistic for no reason
- Biased to random events
## Developments
The [[Lean start-up method]] is an application of [[Effectuation]]. It tries to cope with uncertainty during decision-making.
# Multiple opportunities
## Causes of better performance
There are three reasons why identifying multiple market opportunities can lead to better performance:
1. Informed choice-making
2. Optimal markets
3. Imprinting effect of the chosen market
### Informed choice-making
By having several choices, we have more information to evaluate each possible choice. More possible solutions = beter organizational outcomes.
### Optimal markets
Some markets may have a higher average performance, partly due to rent-earning possibilities. Having more possible market applications give you the ability to choose the optimal market.
### Imprinting effects of the chosen market
The market that a firm will operate on will have an impact on the firm's:
- Identity
- Capability
- Assets
- Strategic decisions

By choosing the wrong market, a firm might be stuck with *forced-moves* that they don't really want to make.
## Is it possible?
Being able to identify multiple market opportunities might requires two things:
1. Adequate knowledge base
2. New team members and alliances
