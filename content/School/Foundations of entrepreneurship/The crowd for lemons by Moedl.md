**Author**: [[Michael M. Moedl]]
**Research question**:
# Abstract
This paper researches if the *pecking order* in the choice of source of funding of new ventures tells something about the quality of the venture.

[[Venture capital|VC]]s believe that *lemons*, or low-quality [[Start-up]]s, more often turn to crowd-based funding for first sources of funding. This suggests a negative bias towards crowd-based financing.
