**Title**: Does Entrepreneurship Pay? An Empirical Analysis of the Returns to Self-Employment
**Author**: [[Barton H. Hamilton]]
**Research question**: 
# Abstract
The research finds that most entrepreneurs enter and persist in self-employment even though initial earnings and earnings growth is much lower than a paid employee. This would mean that the nonpecuniary benefits of self-employment, such as *being your own boss* must have a substantial impact on the decision to become self-employed.
