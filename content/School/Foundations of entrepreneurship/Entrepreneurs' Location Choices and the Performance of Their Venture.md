**Author**: [[Michael S. Dahl]]
**Year**: 2012
**Research question**: Does starting a company in your deep roots have impact on performance?
# Abstract
Entrepreneurs have a tendency to start companies where they have deep roots (f.e. lived the longest). Does this impact performance f.e. due to choosing to spend more time with family.

Result is that firms perform better (longer survival, higher profits, higher cash flows) when they're founded in these deep rooted locations.

This effect is as substantial as prior industry experience is on firm performance.
