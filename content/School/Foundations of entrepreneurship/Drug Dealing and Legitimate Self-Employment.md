**Title**: Drug Dealing and Legitimate Self-Employment
**Author**: [[Robert W. Fairly]] 
**Research question**: Do attitudes toward risk, entrepreneurial ability and autonomy create an incentive to become an entrepreneur?
# Abstract
The study tried to indirectly prove the following statement: "Attitudes toward risk, entrepreneurial ability and autonomy create an incentive to become an entrepreneur". The study questioned drug-dealers and found that they are 11 to 21% more likely to choose self-employment.
# Setup
Entrepreneurs are believed to have the following traits:
- Entrepreneurial ability / generalist skills ([[Entrepreneurship by Lazear]])
- Preference for autonomy / non-pecuniary benefits ([[Does Entrepreneurship Pay by Hamilton|Paper by Hamilton]])
- Risk attitude

The research tests whether attitudes above actually create an incentive to become an entrepreneur by using drug-dealing as a proxy for these traits. If drug-dealers are more likely to become self-employed, then people with these traits are more likely too.
# Motivation
Labor economics up till then had focused on wage and salary workers, but self-employment has dramatically risen in recent decades.
# Limitations
- Drug dealers as proxies is problematic, in case of drug dealers that deal for reasons unrelated to risk, entrepreneurial ability and autonomy.
- Does not measure independently the impact of the three factors.
# Conclusion
Drug dealing has a positive effect on later self-employment. Young dealers are 11 to 21% more likely to become self-employed later on.

Basic skills and education have a much smaller effect on the probability of becoming self-employed than having dealt drugs. This thus means that these personality traits should have a bigger impact than the education and skill set of a person.
