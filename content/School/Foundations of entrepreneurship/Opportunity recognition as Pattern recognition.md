# Abstract
This research suggested that entrepreneurs use a cognitive framework that they acquired through experience to *connect the dots* between trends in [[PESTEL-analysis|PESTEL]] and concrete applications in a new business. 

This suggested model has three pros:
1. Integrates three important aspects into one framework, they:
	1. actively search for opportunities.
	2. are alert to opportunities.
	3. have prior industry or market knowledge.
2. Explains why some people recognize opportunities and others don't
3. Specifies a way for would-be entrepreneurs to train in recognizing opportunities
# Setup
Earlier research provided key characteristics for opportunity recognition:
1. Actively search for opportunities
2. Alert to opportunities
3. Prior industry or market knowledge
## Motivation
Prior research has defined above traits, but they haven't been included into one framework.
## Pattern recognition
Pattern recognition involves being able to *connect the dots* between seemingly unrelated events or trends. It is crucial to understand the world around us and find opportunities which other might not have thought about.

Three parts of the paper:
1. Assumptions
2. Two models for pattern recognition
3. Integration of factors into one framework
# Content
## Propositions
1. Opportunities references three characteristics:
	- Potential economic value
	- Newness
	- Desireability
2. Pattern recognition depends on a persons mental framework developed through experience. Past information is used as templates to find connections in new situations.
