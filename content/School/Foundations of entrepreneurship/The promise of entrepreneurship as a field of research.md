## Definition of an entrepreneur
### Entrepreneurship as research field
Before, entrepreneurship was defined as a certain type of person and what that person does. In reality, entrepreneurship involves a *nexus* of two phenomena: 1. **Presence of opportunities** and 2. **presence of and enterprising individual**.

Three fundamental questions on entrepreneurship:
1. Why, when and how do entrepreneurial opportunities come into existence?
2. Why, when and how some people discover and exploit these opportunities?
3. Why, when and how different methods are used to exploit these opportunities?

Shane and S.V. then define entrepreneurship as
> *"... the scholarly examination of how, by whom, and with what effects opportunities to create future goods and services are discovered, evaluated, and exploited."*
### Caveats
#### Equilibrium and disequilibrium approach
Most researchers apply an equilibrium approach. This means that from their POV, some people have an attribute/characteristics which makes them *see* entrepreneurial opportunities. People who don't have this won't see this.

Shane and S.V. believe that this isn't completely correct. They don't believe that there's one standalone characteristic like this. They believe some people simply have a tendency to discover more of these opportunities than others.
#### No creation of an organization
S. and S. believe that entrepreneurship doesn't necessarily entail the creation of an entrepreneurial organization. The entrepreneurial idea can be executed in an existing organization or sold to someone else.
## Motivation of the study
Three reasons:
1.  Entrepreneurship converts technology into products and services so entrepreneurship is embodied in these products and services.
2. Entrepreneurship discovers and mitigates [[Temporal inneficiency|temporal]] and [[Spatial efficiency|spatial inefficiencies]].
3. Entrepreneurship advances innovation and is thus a crucial part in our economy.
## Existence, discovery and exploitation
### Existence of opportunities
Opportunities arise when goods, services, raw material and organization  can be sold at a greater price than the cost of production. Not the same as optimizing an existing opportunity.

The recognition of these opportunities is subjective, but the existence is objective and not know to everyone.

**Three categories:**
1. Invention of new technologies
2. Exploitation of inefficiencies because of information asymmetry
3. Reduction of costs

These are discovered when someone recognizes that resources are not put to *best use* or prices are *too low*. The believes of people differ in this sense.

Two reasons why these opportunities exist:
1. People make mistakes
2. Economy evolves and creates disequilibria
### Discovery of opportunities
Two reasons why some people can discover and exploit opportunities and others can't:
1. [[Information corridors]]
2. [[Cognitive properties for opportunity recognition|Cognitive properties]]
### Exploitation of opportunities
Why when and how opportunities are exploited depends on two factors:
1. The nature of the opportunity
2. Individual preference
#### Nature of an opportunity
An entrepreneur will only exploit an opportunity if the expected value of the exploitation is higher than the opportunity cost. The following influence this expected value:
- High demands
- High profit margins
- Young technology life cycle
- Average density of the opportunity space
- Low cost of capital
- Entrants can learn from the population
#### Individual preference
Several personal factors influence whether someone would exploit an opportunity:
- Different [[Risk-aversion]]
- Different perceived chances of success
- Possessing the personality to follow through with the exploitation
- Being able to act in the face of skepticism

Important note:
Being more willing to exploit opportunities, doesn't mean that chances of success are higher. 
#### Method of exploitation
There are two major ways to exploit an opportunity:
- Creation of an organization
- Sale to an existing organization
# Limitations
The paper focuses on the exploitation of opportunities by entrepreneurs, not necessarily the creation of new entrepreneurial organizations.
