# Abstract
Traditionally scholars have believed that the entrepreneurial environment is conform the concept of [[Causation]]. SDS believes that an [[Effectuation]] view is more appropriate.

## Introduction
The paper begins by challenging the traditional perspective of entrepreneurship as a linear process with predetermined goals and plans. Sarasvathy introduces the concepts of causation and effectuation as two distinct logics guiding entrepreneurial decision-making, setting the stage for a reevaluation of prevailing theories.
## Literature Review
A critical examination of existing entrepreneurship theories is undertaken, highlighting their limitations. The review identifies gaps in understanding the cognitive processes of entrepreneurs, providing the basis for Sarasvathy's proposal of a new theoretical framework.
## Causation Logic
This section delves into the causation logic, characterized by goal-setting, planning, and the belief in a predictable environment. Entrepreneurs following this approach aim to control and foresee outcomes, reflecting a traditional and deterministic view of entrepreneurship.
## Effectuation Logic
In contrast, the effectuation logic is explored, emphasizing adaptability, leveraging existing resources, and embracing uncertainty. Entrepreneurs employing effectuation see the future as malleable, viewing opportunities as emergent and co-created, rather than simply predicted and exploited.
## Comparison and Contrast
A detailed analysis compares and contrasts causation and effectuation. The section elucidates the fundamental differences in mindset, decision-making processes, and the outcomes associated with each logic, reinforcing the need for a nuanced understanding of entrepreneurial approaches.
## Theoretical Shift
The paper argues for a paradigm shift in entrepreneurship theory, advocating for the incorporation of both causation and effectuation. The proposed theoretical framework recognizes the contingency and adaptability inherent in entrepreneurial endeavors, departing from a deterministic perspective.
## Practical Implications
The paper explores how the proposed theoretical shift could influence practical aspects of entrepreneurship. Insights are provided for entrepreneurs, educators, and policymakers, encouraging an appreciation for the dynamic and contingent nature of entrepreneurial processes.
## Conclusion
The paper concludes by summarizing key points and emphasizing its contribution to the field. Sarasvathy underscores the importance of recognizing and integrating both causation and effectuation for a more holistic understanding of entrepreneurial behavior and outcomes.
