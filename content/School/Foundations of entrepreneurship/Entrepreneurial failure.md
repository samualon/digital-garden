# Determinants of performance
Three drivers of succes:
- Opportunity (Kirznerian and Schumpeterian)
- Resources (financial and social)
- Talent ([[human capital]])

Traditional believe is that economic performance determines succes, but [[Entrepreneurial Human Capital and the Persistence of Underperforming Firms by Gimeno]] shows that this might not be the case. It depends on:
- Economic performance AND
- Human capital of the entrepreneur
