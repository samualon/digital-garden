## Discussion
Having had many different roles is productive in becoming an [[Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneur]], but having had many different employers is counterproductive in this matter. The reason could be because it could seem as if you are less stable as a team manager.

There is a slight contradiction between this paper and [[The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research]] as in the latter paper, Shane et al. are of the opinion that an entrepreneur should have a certain specialized knowledge in a field in order to identify [[Opportunities in entrepreneurship|opportunities]] while this paper states that you shouldn't specialize in a field.
