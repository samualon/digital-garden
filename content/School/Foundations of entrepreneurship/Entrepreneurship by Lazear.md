**Title**: Entrepreneurship
**Author**: [[Edward P. Lazear]]
**Research question**:
# Abstract
An entrepreneur mustn't have one skill but must be a *jack-of-all-trades*, a balanced skill set is required. A study on Stanford students found that people with a varied work and education were more likely to become an entrepreneur.
# Conclusion
There are two evidences for the statement above.
## Evidence 1
People who have had more roles and a varied career are more probable to become an entrepreneur. This can be because of two reasons:
1. People have a diverse set of skills and thus behave on the labor market conform this skill set.
2. People actively try to *invest* in having a diverse skill set as it is seen necessary in becoming an entrepreneur.
## Evidence 2
The pattern of investing in a varied skill set is consistent with the empirical findings. Students with a varied curriculum were more likely to start a business over their career.
# Discussion
Having had many different roles is productive in becoming an [[Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneur]], but having had many different employers is counterproductive in this matter. The reason could be because it could seem as if you are less stable as a team manager.

There is a slight contradiction between this paper and [[The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research]] as in the latter paper, Shane et al. are of the opinion that an entrepreneur should have a certain specialized knowledge in a field in order to identify [[Opportunities in entrepreneurship|opportunities]] while this paper states that you shouldn't specialize in a field.
# Implications
In the "Are entrepreneurs born or made" discussion, this paper brings forward the fact that you can develop entrepreneurial skills by education and entrepreneurial experience.
