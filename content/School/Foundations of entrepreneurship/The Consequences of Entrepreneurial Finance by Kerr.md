**Title**: The Consequences of Entrepreneurial Finance: Evidence from Angel Financings
**Author**: [[William R. Kerr]]
**Research question**:
# Abstract
This paper finds that ventures funded by two successful angel groups experience better outcomes than ventures that get rejected. They experience improved:
- Survival
- Exits
- Employment
- Patenting
- Web traffic
- Financing

Additionally, access to other funding has no impact. This means it is likely that angels offer something important besides financing.
