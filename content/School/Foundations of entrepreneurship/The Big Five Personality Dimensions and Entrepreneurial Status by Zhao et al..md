**Title**: The Big Five Personality Dimensions and Entrepreneurial Status
**Author**: [[Hao Zhao]] and [[Scott E. Seibert]]
**Year**: 2006
**Research question**: Which personality factors lead people to choose between becoming an entrepreneur and a manager?
# Abstract
The research examined the relationship between personality and entrepreneurial status. Using the five-factor model of personality, it was found that a difference between entrepreneurs and managers exists on Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Neuroticism and Agreeableness. No difference was found in Extraversion. Differences were small.
# Setup
## Personalities and ES
Zhao and Seibert believe that the the [[ASA framework]] supports the reasoning that personality may impact ES:

Previous research supports the decision to only compare managers and entrepreneurs.
## The Big Five and ES
### Neuroticism
Neuroticism describes emotional stability, being *self-confident, calm and relaxed*.

Managers work in a stable big organization filled with experts and lots of experience. On the other hand, entrepreneurs often work in chaotic environments with much uncertainty and stakeholders like [[Venture capital|venture capitalists]] that put pressure on them. This leads to the following hypothesis:

*Hypothesis 1:* Entrepreneurs will score lower on Neuroticism.
### Extraversion
Extraversion describes the extent to which people are assertive, dominant, energetic, active, talkative, and enthusiastic. 

Since entrepreneurs are expected to have to deal with a wider range of important stakeholders than managers and thus would have to be a *beter salesman*, they are expected to be more extraverted.

*Hypothesis 2*: Entrepreneursw will score higher on Extraversion.
### Openness to experience
Openness to Experience is a personality dimension that characterizes someone who is intellectually curious and tends to seek new experiences and explore novel ideas. The opposite is someone who is very conventional and narrow in intrests.

Since entrepreneurs have a high focus on innovation, they believe they will score higher on this factor.

*Hypothesis 3:* Entrepreneurs will score higher on Openness to experience.
### Agreeableness
The high end of Agreeableness represents someone who has cooperative values and a preference for positive interpersonal relationships. Someone at the low end of the dimension can be characterized as manipulative, self-centered, suspicious, and ruthless

Someone that has low Agreeableness will *drive a hard bargain*. Since disadvantages during a *bargain* are more crucial for entrepreneurs than managers:

*Hypothesis 4:* Entrepreneurs will score lower on Agreeableness.
### Conscientiousness
Conscientiousness indicates an individualâ€™s degree of organization, persistence, hard work, and motivation in the pursuit of goal accomplishment.

Since entrepreneurs rely on themselves more and do things for themselves, instead of managers who do things for the company and co-workers, they believe the following:

*Hypothesis 5:* Entrepreneurs will score higher on Conscientiousness, achievement motivation and dependability.
# Motivation
Personality could play an important role in:
1. Entrepreneurial career intentions
2. Entrepreneurial cognition
3. Opportunity recognition
4. Motivation
5. New venture survival

Earlier research didn't use believable variables. Additionally, contradictions existed between research.

New research developments allowed them to create this new research, such as the big-five factors.
# Limitations
- No indication shown whether it is the choice of the individual or the selection of the environment.
- No research for performance impact of these *ideal entrepreneurs*. Do entrepreneurs need these traits or do most happen to have these traits?
- Large variation in the models --> other unused factors might play a role.
# Results
- Entrepreneurs scored lower on Neuroticism
- Entrepreneurs scored lower on Agreeableness
- Entrepreneurs scored higher on openness
- Entrepreneurs score higher on Conscientiousness
- No clear support for Extraversion
# Discussion
This research isn't about whether some personality traits are mandatory to become successful as an entrepreneur, it researches whether there is a correlation between certain personality traits and the probability to be successful.
