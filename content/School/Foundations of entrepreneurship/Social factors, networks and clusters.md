Two liabilities:
- [[Liability of newness]]
- [[Liability of smallness]]
# The spinout advantage
There are major firm types that could enter a market:

Spinoffs have two major advantages:
1. Easier acquisition of human capital (already have industry knowledge)
2. Easier acquisition of social capital
## Acquisition of human capital
> *"Spinoffs inherit knowledge from their parents that shape their nature at birth."*

Part of the knowledge in the incumbent company that the future entrepreneur works at is [[Tacit knowledge]]. This knowledge is hard to acquire and is thus a big advantage.

Since industry specific knowledge is crucial in setting up a new venture, this has a great performance impact.
## Acquisition of social capital
Prominent social networks have two major advantages:
1. **Opportunity identification:** get access to info that can reveal ideas and opportunities
2. **Resource mobilization:** reputation effect and signaling effect

This network has to be:
- Diverse
- Qualitative
## Alliances
By allying with established rivals, a new company can overcome the [[Liability of newness]].
# Merging of clusters
Spinoffs are often located in [[Clusters]]. But why do clusters merge? Two perspectives:
1. Economic perspective
2. Sociological perspective
## Economic perspective
[[Marshall Industrial District|Marshall's]] agglomeration economies gives an explanation on the basis of three arguments:
- Common resource sharing
- Labour pooling
- Information [[spillovers]]

But this is only good for small [[Start-up]]s, larger firms should look to avoid being this close to rivals.
## Sociological perspective
Since it is often difficult to leverage own ties, they look to cluster such that they can make use of this network. It also helps acquiring [[Tacit knowledge]].

Another explanation is that spinoffs tend to locate close to their *parent*.
