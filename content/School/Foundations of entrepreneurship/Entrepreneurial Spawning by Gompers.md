# Abstract
Two views on creation of [[Venture capital|VC]]-backed [[Start-up]]s:
1. Young firms' processes and exposing of relevant networks prepare employees to become entrepreneurs.
2. Large [[Bureaucratie|bureaucratic]] firms push individuals to become entrepreneurs when they don't fund their ideas.

The most prolific spawners are [[Venture capital|VC]]-backed and are based in Silicon Valley or Massachusetts.
