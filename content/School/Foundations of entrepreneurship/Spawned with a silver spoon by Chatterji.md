**Title**: Spawned with a silver spoon? Entrepreneurial performance and innovation in the medical device industry
**Author**: [[Aaron K. Chatterji]]
**Year**: 2008
**Research question**: Do spawns perform well?
# Abstract
We already know that spawning occurs, where entrepreneurs have prior experience at incumbents, but what is the performance impact?

Spawns (firms started by former employees of incumbents) outperform other [[Start-up]]s. Furthermore, performance could often not be driven by technological [[spillovers]] but by nontechnical knowledge (such as marketing and strategy).
