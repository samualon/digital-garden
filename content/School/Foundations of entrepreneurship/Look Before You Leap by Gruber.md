**Author**: [[Marc Gruber]]
**Year**: 2008
**Research question**:

2. Do serial entrepreneurs profit in performance by identifying multiple potential market entries?
# Abstract
Since new technology can serve different markets, entrepreneurs can often identify multiple possible entry market. 

Empirical results showed three major insights:
1. Before choosing one, serial entrepreneurs make a choice-set of different market opportunities.
2. Identifying a choice set like above derives performance benefits because of it.
3. There's a a positive relationship between amount of identified market opportunities and firm performance, which is nonlinear and marginally decreasing.

## Nonlinear and marginally decreasing
There are two reasons for the nonlinear and marginally decreasing properties of the positive relationship:
1. Identifying more possibilities requires more resources.
2. The more possibilities that need to be identified, the more complex the task becomes.
