**Author**: [[J. P. Eggers]] and [[Lin Song]]
**Year**: 2015
**Research question**:
# Abstract
This research theorizes that failing entrepreneurs will change industry and that this industry change is detrimental since they can't use the experience that they gained in the previous industry.

They are also unlikely to attribute and change the failure to their own aspects (such as leadership, decision-making, planning style).

Above aspects are named as:
- **Attribution**: blaming external factors
- **Industry change**
- **Negative effect of industry change**
