# Overview
1. Where?
2. Why?
3. How?
# Difference idea and opportunity
An idea is simply a solution to a compelling market need. An opportunity is the building of a concrete business around this need using resources, creating value and generating profit.

To recognize an opportunity one has to:
1. Discover a fit between a need in the market and the available resources.
2. Create a solution that can deliver the value to the market need.

The definition of an opportunity in the paper [[Opportunity recognition as Pattern recognition#Propositions|of Baron]] is very similar to the earlier definition in [[The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research#Existence of opportunities|the paper of Shane et al.]].
# Where do opportunities come from?
## Schumpeterian entrepreneur
Schumpeter believes an entrepreneur finds ways to initiate changes in the economy. He disturbs the economical equilibrium by actively creating new opportunities in a process that he calls [[Creative distruction]]. Opportunities emerge from the creation of new information.

Examples include:
- Introduction of new goods or services
- Introduction of new production methods
- New source of supplies
- New organizational structures / business models
- Regulatory changes
## Kirznerian entrepreneur
Kirzner believes an entrepreneur possibilities in correcting errors by differential access to already existing information.

To exploit these inefficiencies, he has to be very alert to discovering them. 
## Comparison
| Schumpeterian | Kirznerian |
| ---- | ---- |
| Innovation | Arbitrage |
| Dis-equilibrium | Making equilibrium |
| Active creation | Passive discovery |
| New information | No new information |
| Dynamic | Static |
| Rare occurence | Common occurence |
# Why are opportunities discovered?
Three different views on this quesion:

| View | *Allocation view* | *Discovery view* | *Creative view* |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Name** | Neoclassical equilibrium theory | Austrian school | [[Effectuation]] |
| **Explanation** | Opportunities are randomly distributed and everyone can recognize them. Personal preference decides if someone will be an entrepreneur and use them. | Bcs of information asymmetry, not everyone can recognize opportunities. ([[Creativity and or alertness by Kirzner]]) | Opportunities are created by linking new means and new ends. (Schumpeterian) |
| **Type of approach** | Economic approach | Economic approach | Sociological approach |
One special approach, the **Psychological approach**: opportunities are neglected, it solely depends on a persons willingness and ability to take action.
# How are opportunities discovered
[[Opportunity recognition as Pattern recognition]] tells us that in order to recognize opportunities one has to have following traits:
- Alertness
- Prior industry or market knowledge - Active search 

![[Baron's pattern recognition.png]]
## Alertness
One needs to be observant of new trends and be able to connect the dots between these changes.
## Prior knowledge
Not everyone can discover opportunities as there are [[Information corridors]]. Three major dimensions, prior knowledge of:
- markets
- ways of serving the market
- customer problems
