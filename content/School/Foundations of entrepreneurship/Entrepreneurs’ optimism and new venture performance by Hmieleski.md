# Abstract
## Entry into Entrepreneurship
Overconfidence can be beneficial to entrepreneurs when they decide to found their own startup. A higher level of confidence is likely to encourage founders to take action before they have all the information necessary to fully evaluate the situation, because they are more likely to focus on own abilities instead of on the external environment. 
## Performance
Founders may overestimate their ability to attract resources and thus start with less seed funding, or be too optimistic in their assessment of consumer demand. High levels of optimism were associated with decrease in revenue growth and employment growth (Hmielski & Baron, 2009, AMJ). 
## Exit
Founders who are convinced of the value of their startup will be more comfortable with rejecting acquisition offers from companies they believe are offering too low a price
