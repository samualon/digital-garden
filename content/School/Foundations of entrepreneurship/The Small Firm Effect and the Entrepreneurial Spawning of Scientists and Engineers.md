# Abstract
Scientists and engineers are far more likely than large firm scientists and engineers to become entrepreneurs. This is called the [[Small firm effect]] and is the result of four classes of explanation (see [[#Content]]).
# Content
## Explenation of the effect
Four classes of explanation for this effect:
1. Preference sorting
2. Ability sorting
3. Opportunity cost
4. Development of entrepreneurial human capital
### Preference sorting
Since they are more likely to be attracted to self-employment, and people with a preference for self-employment often become entrepreneurs, they are likely to also become entrepreneurs.
### Ability sorting
High-ability scientists will want to maximize their expected earnings, which is why they'll want to start as an entrepreneur.
### Opportunity cost
No consistent evidence that the level of pay between small firm and big firm engineers and scientists would have an impact.
### Development of entrepreneurial human capital
Since employees in small firms will often have a broader range of activities and responsibilities, they are more often a *jack-of-all-trades* (see [[Characteristics of an entrepreneur]]). 

Although it could be that *jacks-of-all-trades* are more often selected for small firms, it is likely that employees also develop these capabilities.
## Conclusion
Results suggest that the small firm effect may play a role in the creation of new entrepreneurs, but also in the performance of these new entrepreneurs.
