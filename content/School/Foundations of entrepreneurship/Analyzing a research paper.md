# Key components
## What
Which factors, variables, concepts are used to explain the research results? 

Judgement of these criteria can be done by checking:
- **Comprehensiveness**: are all relevant variables included?
- **Parsimony**: should some variables be deleted?
## How
How are the variables in the [[#What]] related?
## Why
Why does the research use the variables in the [[#What]]. Which underlying theories justify this decission?
## Limitations
What are the boundaries of the research?
