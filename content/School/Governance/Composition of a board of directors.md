The composition of a [[Board of Directors]] is highly dependent on the sector.
## Legal requirements
The [[Companies and Association Code]] requires at least 3 directors in an LLC (NV), unless there are fewer than three shareholders. In that case 2 are required.
## Balance
There's a trade-off between:
- Smaller size = efficient decisions
- Bigger size = diversity in knowledge and experience
## Types of board members
- [[External director]]
- [[Internal director]]
- [[Executive director]]
- [[Non-executive director]]
- [[Independent director]]
## Diversity quota
**For listed companies**, at least $\frac{1}{3}$ of members should be the other sex.

Listed companies have 6 years after listing to hit this quota, unless the free float is less than 50%. Then they get an additional 2 years. 
## Business personalities
There are four major business personalities:

| Personality | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Pioneer |  |
| Driver |  |
| Dreamer/integrator/teamer |  |
| Guardian |  |
