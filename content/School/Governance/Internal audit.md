![[Internal and external audit flows.png]]
An internal audit has to compare internal activities to the policies made by the company (*the police of the company*). It reports its findings to the [[Audit committee]].
## Functions
Internal audit has 3 roles:
- **Assure**: check that right processes are in place.
- **Advise**: report on possible changes to company policy.
- **Anticipate**: deliver forward-looking advice.
## Types of internal audit
- Financial audit
- Operational audit
- Compliance audit: does the company comply with policy and laws?
- IT audit
- Program and project audit
- Forensic audit: detect fraudulent practices
## IA in practice
IA has to decide upon how much residual risk the company takes. This residual risk is the risk that resides after all the control that the company tries to impose.

IA also has to focus on both not having ineffective control and overcontrolling.
