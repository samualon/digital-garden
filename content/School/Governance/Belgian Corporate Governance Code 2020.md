This is the third version of Belgian CG Code for listed companies. It build upon earlier code and allowed listed companies to better adres their specific circumstances.
## Comply or explain
Sometimes a company will diverge from the code. If this happens, they have to explain why they do so.

This could happen f.e. when the code interferes with law for a certain company.
## Main changes
There are five main changes between the BCGC 2020 and previous codes:
1. Choice between monistic and [[Dualistic board]]
2. More explicit expectations for diversity, talent development, succession planning and reporting of non-financial matters
3. Focus on sustainable value creation
4. Addition of the [[Audit committee]]
5. Introduction of [[Say on Pay]], the new renumeration policy.
