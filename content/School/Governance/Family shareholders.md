Family shareholders, often referred to as [[Patient capital]], have a focus on:
- Long-term health
- Short-term needs
- Family control
- Supporting liquidity of [[Shareholders]] through dividends

Often times family members have an emotional connection to the business. 

A typical challenge for family shareholders is not mixing the corporate governance with problems in the family. This is why they will often have a [[Family council]] and a [[Family charter]].
