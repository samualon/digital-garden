## Definition
[[Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020]] defines [[Corporate Governance]] as 
> "... a set of rules which determines how companies are managed and controlled. A good [[Corporate Governance]] model achieves its goal by balancing 1. leadership, entrepreneurship and performance and 2. conformity to the aforementioned rules.

A good [[Corporate Governance]] model safeguards interests of all stakeholders, not only shareholders. Stakeholders are:
- Financial institutions
- Suppliers
- Staff
- Customers
- The public interest
## History
Throughout history, there have been many examples of bad [[Corporate Governance]] resulting in painful scandals (f.e. [[Polly Peck]]).

This resulted in a transformation from *soft laws* to *hard laws* (unenforced to enforced).

The latest is the [[Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020]], which is imposed on publicly listed companies.

Non-listed companies have no legislation. For them, codes recommendations. This is because we believe CG should evolve as the company grows.
## Basic principles
### General structure
Generally, a company's structure is composed of of three major stakeholders who form the [[Governance Tripod]]:
- [[Shareholders]]
- [[Board of Directors]]
- [[Management committee]]
- [[Chief executive officer]], which is positioned in between the BoD and the management committee.

### Unitary and dualistic boards
There are two major board structures:
- [[Unitary board]] or [[Unitary board|One-tier board]]
- [[Dualistic board]] or [[Dualistic board|Two-tier board]]

It's important to note that it's **not one size fits all**.
