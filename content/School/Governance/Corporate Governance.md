## Definition
[[Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020]] defines [[Corporate Governance]] as 
> "... a set of rules which determines how companies are managed and controlled. A good [[Corporate Governance]] model achieves its goal by balancing 1. leadership, entrepreneurship and performance and 2. conformity to the aforementioned rules.

A good [[Corporate Governance]] model safeguards interests of all [[Corporate governance stakeholders|stakeholders]], not only shareholders. 
## History
Throughout history, there have been many examples of bad [[Corporate Governance]] resulting in painful scandals (f.e. [[Polly Peck]]).

This resulted in a transformation from *soft laws* to *hard laws* (unenforced to enforced).

The latest is the [[Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020]], which is imposed on publicly listed companies.

Non-listed companies have no legislation. For them, codes recommendations. This is because we believe CG should evolve as the company grows.
## Basic principles
### General structure
Generally, a company's structure is composed of of three major stakeholders who form the [[Governance Tripod]]:
- [[Shareholders]]
- [[Board of Directors]]
- [[Management committee]]
- [[Chief executive officer]], which is positioned in between the BoD and the management committee.

### Unitary and dualistic boards
There are two major board structures:
- [[Unitary board]] or [[Unitary board|One-tier board]]
- [[Dualistic board]] or [[Dualistic board|Two-tier board]]

It's important to note that it's **not one size fits all**.
### Reporting
A publicly listed company has to rapport on following things in their annual rapport:
- [[Corporate Governance reporting]]
- [[Remuneration reporting]]
### Auditing
There are two types of audits that a listed company could perform:
- [[Internal audit]]
- [[External audit]]

![[Internal and external audit.png]]
Internal audit focuses on effectiveness of company performance and is important to the company itself.

External audit focuses on the organizations financial statements and is important to third parties that need correct financial information.
