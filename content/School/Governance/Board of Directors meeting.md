The [[Board of Directors]] should regularly meet in person at least four times a year. Written decisions are a possibility, but not for very important aspects. Smaller companies often mostly have meetings on paper.

Board members should prepare for the meetings in advance and meetings should be announced well in advance to ensure maximal attendance.
## Effective meetings
In order to run effective meetings, there should be a focus on the following:
- Relevant and focused agenda
- Ground rules for debating
- Directors have expression, listening and social skills
