Albert Camus was an Algerian philosopher and writer who won the Nobel prize for literature.

He wrote several highly commended books, such as [[L'étranger]].
## Philosophy
### Absurdity
He believed that life is meaningless and all the apparent meaning that we have of the world are our own constructs. 

> "I don’t know whether this world has a meaning that transcends it. But I know that I cannot know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it. ”

> "What can a meaning outside my condition mean? I can understand only in human terms."
> - *Albert camus, [[The Myth of Sisyphus]]*

Camus calls the world absurd. Humans are rational and want to create order, but they are faced with a silent universe which is irrational and meaningless.
### Living in an absurd world
He describes philosophical suicide as the way that humans create constructs to escape this absurdity (religion, belief in karma, etc.).

The fact that the world is meaningless doesn't mean that we should commit suicide, says Camus. He sees the meaningless of life, the absence of an afterlife, as an opportunity to focus on our current life and create meaning of our own. We should revolt against the absurd, not accept it. We should live life to the fullest in the face of the absurd.
### Myth of Sisyphus
Camus described a tale of a man, Sisyphus, who challenged the gods. As a punishment he had to push a rock up a hill, but every time he got to the top the rock would fall.

This pushing of the rock is absurd, it has no meaning. But Camus sees the pushing of the rock as meaning. The fight to get the rock to the top is enough to fill his heart.
