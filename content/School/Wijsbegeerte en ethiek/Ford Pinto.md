During the oil crisis in the 1970s, the demand for small cars dramatically increased.

Ford developed a new car where the gas tank was at the back of the car below the rear axis. 
## Court case
This position for the tank had a danger for fire in case of an accident, which is why Ford had a court case.

Lifting the tank would cost $11 dollars per car.

Ford's lawyers had two arguments:
- Juridical argument
- [[Utilitarisme|Utilitarian]] argument
### Juridical argument
No laws existed that prohibited the placement of the fuel tank under the rear axis.
### Utilitarian argument
The cost to fix all cars would be 137 million USD. The cost if they didn't fix it would be 49.5 million USD 
($49.5M = 180 \: deaths * 200K + 180 \: burns * 67K + 2100 \: cars * 700$ ).

Since fixing the cars would cost more and thus reduce utility more than leaving it as is, the case got dismissed.
