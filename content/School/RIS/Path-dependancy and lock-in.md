Aliases: path-dependancy, lock-in
---
## Definition
Regional economies inherit the [[legacies]] of its own past. This [[legacies|legacy]] shapes the future of the regional development.

This phenomenon is called path-dependant economic evolution in regions.

Path-dependancy could result in the region being 'locked-in' a certain devolopment path, which would result in industrialized specialization in only one domain or theme. This is called lock-in. 

## Important mechanisms of lock-in
1. [[Technological interrelatedness]]
2. [[Economies of scale|Economies of scale]]
3. Quasi irreversibility of investments

## Escaping path-dependancy with policy
Possibility and potential of policy intervention.

How difficult it is for policy makers to resolve path-dependancy is determined by historical depth.

Key mechanics to resolve path dependancy:
1. [[Regional absorptive capacity]] 
2. [[Technological relatedness to the region's legacies]]
4. [[Regional buzz]] and [[Global pipelines]]
