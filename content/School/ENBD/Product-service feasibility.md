This part of a [[Feasibility analysis]] assesses the desirability and demand of the product or service and consists of two parts:
1. Product/service desirability
2. Product/service demand

## Product/service desirability
There are four questions we should ask ourselves concerning desirability of the product or service:
- Is the [[Window of opportunity]] open?
- Is the product or service reasonable?
- Does the product or service take advantage of an [[Opportunities in entrepreneurship#Identifying opportunities|opportunity]] (trends, solve a problem, find a gap in the market)?
- Are there fatal flaws of the fundamentals of the product or service?

In this part we also administer a concept test. In this test we develop a [[Concept statement]] and use the feedback from the test to test for viability and tweak the product or service if needed.
## Product/service demand
There are two steps in this part:
1. Administering a buying intentions survey which tests for people's interest.
2. Complement the results from the buying intentions survey with results from the internet, books, research, etc.
