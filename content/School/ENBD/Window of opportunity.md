A window of opportunity defines the time period in which a business can realistically enter a new market. 

Once an opportunity has been recognized, this market will fill with new businesses until the market is saturated. The window of opportunity is closed at this point.

An open window means there is no standard in the market that consumers expect yet, consumers also don't have high demands for the product or service yet.

A closed window on the contrary does have a certain standard in the market and consumers start to develop high demands for the product or service.
## Remarks
1. Windows of opportunities can reopen
2. A closed window of opportunity doesn't mean you shouldn't start-up. The timing just makes it a bit more difficult.
