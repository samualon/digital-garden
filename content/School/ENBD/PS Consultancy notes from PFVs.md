## Low threat of new entrants
Since experience in the consultancy industry is crucial, we have a high entry barrier to overcome as a new consultancy firm. Some ways to overcome this barrier:
- Free test cases on real firms
- Certificates for courses
- Experts with much experience in our team
- Connections to experts (in the field, professors, etc.)
- Our prior experience (projects)
