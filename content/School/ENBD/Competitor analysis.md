## Definition
A competitor analysis attempts to gather details and describe competitors using three competitor categories: 
- [[Direct competitor]]
- [[Indirect competitor]]
- [[Future competitor]]

A [[Competitor analysis grid]] offers a way to graphically represent the information gained in this analysis.
