A competitor analysis grid gives insight of the strength of our competitors compared to each other and our own company.

There are three steps to building a competitor analysis grid:
1. Gather information
2. Identify [[Critical Succes Factors|CSF]]'s
3. Establish a score for each company on evvery [[Critical Succes Factors|CSF]]
## Gather information
Before building a competitor analysis grid, we need information of the the competitor, this is called [[Competitive analysis]]. This can be gathered by:
- purchasing competitors products or services.
- analyse competitors web sites.
- talk to customers of the competitors.
- ...
## Identify CSF's
We should identify the [[Critical Succes Factors]] of the target market. Some [[Critical Succes Factors|CSF]]'s could be copied over from an [[Industry analysis]].

You should define at least 8 to 10 [[Critical Succes Factors|CSF]]'s.
## Establish scores
Here we should score each competitor on each [[Critical Succes Factors|CSF]]. Customer input is required, as our own believes will probably be subjective.
