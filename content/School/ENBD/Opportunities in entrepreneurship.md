Opportunities can be defined using ideas.

An idea is a thought / impression / notion. An opportunity is an idea which are anchored to a service or product and create value for buyers / users.

There are four crucial properties of an opportunity, it's:
- attractive
- timely
- durable
- anchored to a product or service and creates value for a buyer / user

Opportunities are often time-bound, we then speak of a [[Window of opportunity]].

## Identifying opportunities
There are three factors which can define an opportunity:
1. Observing trends
2. Solving a problem
3. Finding gaps in the marketplace
### Observing trends
Several trends create opportunities for entrepreneurs. The most important trends in opportunities can be found by doing a [[PESTEL-analysis]]. 
### Solving a problem
Through [[PESTEL-analysis]] or personal [[Intu√Øtie|intuition]] we can find problems. A solution to these problems could be an opportunity.
### Finding gaps in the marketplace
A gap in a marketplace is a need from a specific group of people which isn't filled yet.
