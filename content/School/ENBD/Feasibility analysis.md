A feasibility analysis determines whether a business opportunity is viable.

Before [[Writing a business plan]], we should do a feasibility analysis to check if the product or service resulting from an opportunity is possible. We should do this as early as possible to evade lost spending and investment.

There are four parts to a feasibility analysis: 
- [[Product-service feasibility]]
- [[Industry-market feasibility]]
- [[Organizational feasibility]]
- [[Financial feasibility]]
