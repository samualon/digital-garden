A feasibility analysis determines whether a business opportunity is viable.

Before [[Development of a business plan|developing a business plan]], we should do a feasibility analysis to check if the product or service resulting from an opportunity is possible. We should do this as early as possible to evade lost spending and investment.

There are four parts to a feasibility analysis: 
- Product/service feasibility
- Industry/market feasibility
- Organizational feasibility
- Financial feasibility

## Product/service feasibility
This part of the feasibility analysis assesses the desirability of the product or service and consists of two parts:
1. Product/service desirability
2. Product/service demand
### Product/service desirability
There are four questions we should ask ourselves concerning desirability of the product or service:
- Is the [[Window of opportunity]] open?
- Is the product or service reasonable?
- Does the product or service take advantage of an [[Opportunities in entrepreneurship#Identifying opportunities|opportunity]] (trends, solve a problem, find a gap in the market)?
- Are there fatal flaws of the fundamentals of the product or service?

In this part we also administer a concept test. In this test we develop a [[Concept statement]] and use the feedback from the test to test for viability and tweak the product or service if needed.
### Product/service demand
There are two steps in this part:
1. Administering a buying intentions survey which tests for people's interest.
2. Complement the results from the buying intentions survey with results from the internet, books, research, etc.
## Industry/market feasibility
This part consists of two components:
1. Industry attractiveness
2. Target market attractiveness

We can use [[Porter's five forces]] to assess the attractiveness of the industry and target market.
## Organizational feasibility
This part assesses if the organisational team has enough expertise, organizational competence and non-financial resources and consists of two parts:
1. Management prowess[ยน]: the team should have passion for the business opportunity
2. Resource sufficiency
## Financial feasibility
This preliminary financial assessment consists of three components:
1. Total start-up cash needed: list all capital purchases and operating expenses to generate the first $1 in income.
2. Financial performance against similar businesses
3. Financial attractiveness of the venture:
	1. Growth in sales?
	2. Recurring revenue?
	3. Internally generated funds to sustain growth?
