[[Michael Porter]]'s five forces model assesses the attractiveness of an industry or sub-industry against each other.

It consists of five forces which could make the industry more or less attractive:
1. Competition in the industry
2. Bargaining power of suppliers
3. Bargaining power of customers
4. Threat of new entrants
5. Threat of substitute products or services
