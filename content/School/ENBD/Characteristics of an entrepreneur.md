# Core characteristics
There are several characteristics that are necessary to be successful as an entrepreneur:
- Passion for the business
- Product-customer focus
- Tenacity despite failure[¹]

[¹]: The EU and the USA have different views on failure. In the EU, failure of an entrepreneur is stigmatized. In the USA, failure is seen as a part of the development of an entrepreneur.
# Secondary characteristics
These characteristics may help, but aren't crucial to becoming an entrepreneur:
- Prior industry experience:
	- Helps recognize and evaluate opportunities
	- Has a network
- Prior entrepreneurial experience: will avoid costly mistakes
- Social networks: [[Strong ties and weak ties]]
- Higher education
- Creativity
# Psychological theories
## The ASA framework
According to Schneider, there are three mechanisms which make someone a more successful entrepreneur using the [[ASA framework]].
## Personality traits
### The big five
The [[Big five personality test]] is also used to detect [[Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneurs]]. This was tested in the paper [[The Big Five Personality Dimensions and Entrepreneurial Status by Zhao et al.]] 

The tool is often and globally used, however the research by Zhao et al. is not in full respect. Some  factors/characteristics may be not yet included.
### Risk aversion
A lower risk aversion could be a 6th personality trait which makes someone an [[Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneur]].

Entrepreneurs are less risk-averse than managers, since entrepreneurs have to cope with more uncertain situations and possibilities.

Some academics don't believe that entrepreneurs are less risk-averse, they just set more challenging goals. They would have a high need for achievement, but findings are mixed.
### Optimism and over-optimism
Optimism could also be a personality trait for entrepreneurs, but over-optimism also seems to be very common with this type of people. They overestimate positive outcomes and underestimate negative outcomes. See [[Entrepreneurs’ optimism and new venture performance by Hmieleski]].
### Jack-of-al-traders
The paper [[Entrepreneurship by Lazear]] presents the *jack-of-al-trades*. A person should invest in a diverse set of skills to become a successful entrepreneur.
### The hedgehog and the fox
An old Greek philosophy line. The fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing.

Hedgehogs view the world through one idea, one vision, while foxes use a variety of experience to observe the world since they know the world is to complex to boil down to one idea.
