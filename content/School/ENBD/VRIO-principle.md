VRIO allows us to compare two companies in an industry, unlike [[Porter's five forces]] which only lets us compare entire industries.

VRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability and (well-embedded in the) Organization.

A company progresses trough these four components serially. Having VR only gives you a temporary competitive advantage, you have to have VRI to sustain this advantage.
