**Research question**: What are [[Start-up studios]] and their characteristics?
# Abstract
A [[Start-up studios|Start-up studio]] is an incubation model characterized by internally generated ideas supported by internal sources and a multidisciplenary team.

Definitions of [[Start-up studios]] is unclear, since it's very new and there's little academic research.

The paper aims to further define [[Start-up studios]] and their characteristics. It uses two cases to also assess their impact on small and emerging economic environments.

Findings revealed that [[Start-up studios]] in smaller economic environments differ from [[Start-up studios]] in larger economic environments on the following aspects:
- Funding
- Founder types
- [[Exit strategy]]

Following aspects, however, are similar between the two types of environments:
- Ideation process
- [[Equity]] distribution
- Operations
- Team setup
# Introduction
Entrepreneurial activity is crucial for the development of smaller economies.

Initially this requires government support and interaction between participants of the ecosystem (see [[Knowledge production diffusion and adoption|KPDA]]). Later on, however, [[Entrepreneurial recycling]] becomes more important.

Preventing economic stagnation requires these types of investments in small ecosystems. But some people argue traditional business [[Incubator]]s are not suitable enough.

The emerging new incubation model [[Start-up studios]] could offer a way to be more effective in growing these smaller ecosystems, by focusing on [[Entrepreneurial recycling]].
# Literature review
Findings from previous research:
1. Importance of entrepreneurship
2. Good entrepreneurial ecosystem
## Importance of entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship has shown to be crucial for economic development. However, this entrepreneurship should be grown from the fact that existing resources can be combined with new ideas to create innovation. When entrepreneurship is purely necessity driven, it can be negative for the ecosystem.

Furthermore, this innovation should be fostered by a good economic environment created by policy makers.
## Good entrepreneurial ecosystem
The whole of an [[Entrepreneurial ecosystem]] has the ability to boost venture creation and growth.

What is crucial in an [[Entrepreneurial ecosystem]], is the interaction between elements and participants. Government support is not enough.
## Incubation model
Although [[Incubator|incubation model]] are designed to foster the creation of new ventures, their effectiveness is highly debated.

There are different [[Incubator#Types of incubators|types of incubators]].
