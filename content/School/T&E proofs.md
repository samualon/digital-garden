> [!faq]- Tips hoofdstuk 02
> #### Prices in EMH are frictionless
> $$p_t = \mathbb{E}(\tilde{V}|\mathbb{F}_t)$$
> #### Prices are uncorrelated
> Start from the fact that $\Delta p_t = \epsilon_t$ and thus $cov(\Delta p_t, \Delta p_s) = cov(\epsilon_p, \epsilon_s)$ 
> #### Price impact
> $$PI_t+s = \mathbb{E}(p_{t+s}|\mathbb{F}_{t-1}, d_t) - \mathbb{E}(\tilde{V}|\mathbb{F}_{t-1})$$
> In case of immediate price impact, just drop the $s$ in the equation above.
