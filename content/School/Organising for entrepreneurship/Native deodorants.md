## Background
Founded by Moiz Al. He raised $ 500,000 and owned 90% of the company. He received an offer of $ 100 million from P&G in less than two years after founding.
## Reasons for P&G's high offer
- P&G wanted to reinvent their own business to become more digitized. This way they acquired a business that is extremely good at applying D2C capability.
- They buy out a competitor that could become extremely strong with additional (f.e. [[Venture capital|VC]]) funding.
- They acquire the product and customer portfolio.
## Whether Ali should sell or not
The business is successful. There are several signals for this:
- The generous offer of P&G. 
- The company managed to sell a lot of their product even though the price was double the competition. Thus, very high profit margin. 

As opposed to the traditional bricks-and-mortar business model of competitors, the [[D2C]] business model of Native was disruptive and resulted in:
- constant feedback from users through the site to drive R&D. This relates strongly to the [[Lean start-up method]].
- higher profit margins, since no powerful retailers as distribution channels
