This provides a snapshot of your industry structure and the players you will need to work with to do business, in a linear fashion. $\leftrightarrow$ [[Value network]]

The key concept of the industry value chain is [[Complementary asset]].
# Importance
This VAC (value chain) analysis allows you to think ahead about:
- your competitive position in the value chain.
- possible opportunities and challenges with players in the chain.
- probable consequences of your business model.

To commercialize, you need to attract and negotiate with these key players who control the value added and [[Complementary asset]] of your product/service.
# Structure
The value chain answers four questions:
1. What steps (phases) need to be taken to finally reach the customers?
2. How many phases does your business cover?
3. Who owns the other phases that you don't own?
4. What is their bargaining power?
