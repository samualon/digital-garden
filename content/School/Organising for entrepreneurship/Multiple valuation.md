Multiple valuation uses multiples (like P/E and P/S) of similar companies to determine the price of a private company using these ratios.
# Issues
- Have to find a similar public company
- Prices have to be standardized
# P/E versus P/S
The most often used multiple is P/S above P/E since it:
- doesn't eliminate companies with negative earnings (losses)
- sales are less easy to manipulate than earnings
- sales are less volatile than earnings

One disadvantage is that there have to be sales generated in order to use this multiple, not always the case.
# Example
Company A is a publicly traded company at price USD 50 per share and has earnings of USD 5 per share. The P/E ratio is then:
$$ P/E = \frac{price}{earnings} = \frac{50}{5} = 10 $$
If we then want to value private company B with an earnings per share of USD 4, we can use the P/E ratio of the similar firm:
$$ \frac{price}{4} = 10 \Leftrightarrow price = 10 * 4 \Leftrightarrow price = 40 $$
