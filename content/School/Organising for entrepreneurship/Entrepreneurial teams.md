# Importance of team formation
Conform [[Entrepreneurial team formation by Lazar|(Lazar et al., 2020)]], the founding team has an important implication for the venture performance and success.

Research has shown that 65% of [[VC]]-backed firms fail because of the management team, the remaining 35% is due to the product, the market, functionality, etc. (Gorman S., 1989).
# Solo-found versus team-found
## Dilemma
When should you become a solo founder and when should you pursue co-founders?

![[Flow diagram solo- vs team-founded.png]]

| Choose solo | Choose team |
| ---- | ---- |
| - Founder has enough relevant human and social capital<br>- Founder wants full control<br>- Founder doesn't need support or validation<br>- Business is in small and slow-moving industry | - Founder doesn't have enough relevant human and social capital<br>- Founder doesn't want to do certain tasks at the start of the startup<br>- Founder prefers collaboration<br>- Founder needs support and validatoin<br>- Business is in big and fast-moving industry (especially with first-mover advantages or network effects)  |
## Advantages and disadvantages
| Option | Solo | Team |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| *Advantages* | - Retain equity<br>- Retain control<br>- Avoid communication, coordination and incentive problems | - Fill holes in human and social capital<br>- Increase information gathering ability<br>- Faster reaction time<br>- Support |
| *Disadvantages* | - Solely have to rely on founders human and social capital<br>- Decreased information gathering ability<br>- Slower reaction time<br>- No support | - Sacrifice equity<br>- Sacrifice control<br>- Communication, coordination and incentive problems |
| *Disadvantage mitigation* | - Fill human and social capital holes before starting<br>- Find advisors and mentors<br>- Found in small slow-moving industry | - Evaluate marginal utility for each co-founder added<br>- Develop team decision-making process<br>- Get to know potential team-members first |
## Amount of team members
Side effects of more team members:
- $\uparrow$  coordination costs and inefficiencies
- $\uparrow$ coordination costs $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ role overlap and in-team conflicts
- $\uparrow$ nodes in internal communication, slowing down decision-making

In complex and turbulent industries however, a bigger team is better because it can:
- absorb more info
- process more info
- consider more potential solutions
- brings more perspective to problems
# Team models
There are two major types of entrepreneurial team models:
1. [[DEFT-model]]
2. [[3 R's model]]
