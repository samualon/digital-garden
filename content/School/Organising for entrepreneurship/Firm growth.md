# Introduction
[[Firm growth]] isn't always a good thing or possible. Several growth problems can arise:
- Business doesn't have potential to become an aggressive growth firm
- Business grows too fast
- Succes doesn't always scale
- Insufficient cash / cash flow problems

To manage these problems, growth-related plans (18 to 36 months) should be established. Four aspects to these plans:
- [[Firm growth#Managing growth|Managing growth]]
- [[Firm growth#Challenges of growth|Challenges of growth]]
- [[Firm growth#Strategies for growth|Strategies for growth]]
# Motivation to pursue growth
- Increase firm value
- Employment creation
- Internationalization
- [[Economies of scale]]
- [[Economies of scope]]
# Managing growth
The [[Organizational life cycle]] of a firm has five stages:
1. Introduction
2. Early growth
3. Continuous growth
4. Maturity
5. (Decline)

Each stage has critical points.
## Introduction
$$ Value-proposition $$ 
In this stage, it should be documented what works and what not.
- Product-market fit?
- What are our core strengths and capabilities?
## Early growth
$$ Business \: model $$
This stage is characterized by increasing sales and complexity.

Focus is needed on:
- a founder that works on the business, not in the business.
- formalization (procedures and policies)
## Continuous growth
$$ Company \: structure $$
This stage is characterized by an increasing need for formalization.

Focus on:
- expanding product offering
- expanding markets (new markets)
- evaluate need for a new Top Management Team (TMT)
## Maturity
$$ Efficiency \: and \: external \: growth \: strategies $$
In this stage, growth declines and the focus shifts to efficiency. Growth mostly happens through partnerships, [[Mergers]] and acquisitions, licensing.
## Decline
$$ Leadership \: and \: adaptivity $$
In this stage growth decreases.

A company doesn't have to go into this stage. It depends on:
- strength of leadership
- ability to adapt to a changing environment
# Challenges of growth
Four challenges:
1. [[Managerial capacity problem]]
2. [[Adverse selection]]
3. [[Moral hazard]]
4. Day-to-day challenges
## Day-to-day challenges
| Challenge | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- |
| Cash flow management | Growing firms require growing cash |
| Capital constraints | Growing firms require more capital to expand projects |
| Price stability | Becoming competitive with big players could trigger price wars |
| Quality control | Growing firms need increasing resources to keep quality on standard |
# Strategies for growth
[[Growth strategies]] allow a firm to increase their firm growth. There's a distinction between internal and external growth strategies.
