## By providing evidence
### Analogs or antilogs
Evidence of something that has worked or failed respectively elsewhere, that is comparable to your hypotheses.

### Interviews
Crucial aspects of a good interview:
- Open-ended questions
- 2 types of interviews: problem and solution interviews
- Not selling the product, listen objectively

### Experiments
Develop a prototype to test the hypotheses in the real world.

### Failure
In case of failure of providing evidence, you should ==pivot==!
