# Providing evidence
Three ways to provide evidence:
1. Analogs or antilogs
2. Interviews
3. Experiments
## Analogs or antilogs
Evidence of something that has worked or failed respectively elsewhere, that is comparable to your hypotheses.
## Interviews
Crucial aspects of a good interview:
- Open-ended questions
- 2 types of interviews: problem and solution interviews
- Not selling the product, listen objectively
## Experiments
Develop a [[Minimum viable product]] to test the hypotheses in the real world with [[Early adopters]].

Important to track what you learn and test different versions of the product.
# Failure
In case of failure of providing evidence, you should **pivot**!
