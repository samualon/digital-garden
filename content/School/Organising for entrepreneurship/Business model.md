Your Business model is the whole of your business in a nutshell. It talks about the:
- value-creation = creating a valuable product or service
- value-delivery = delivering this value to the customer
- value-capturing = make money from the product or service

There are methods to [[Product-service operations plan|develop an effective business model]].

## Value-creating versus value-capturing
The value that is captured is the difference between the customer price of the product or service - the cost to produce.

The value that is created is the difference between the max. [[Willingness to pay]] to pay of the customer - the cost to produce.

When thinking about value-creation, we thus compare the cost against the [[Willingness to pay|WTP]] instead of the actual price of the product.
