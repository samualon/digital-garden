A net present value is calculated by discounting all future cash flows to the current moment.
$$ NPV = \frac{R_t}{(1+i)^t} $$
with:
- $R_t =$ cash flow at time $t$.
- $i =$ discount rate (intrest rate)

# Advantages and disadvantages
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---- | ---- |
| Clear and concrete | Depends on reliable cash flow projections |
| Considers time value of money | Discount rate is hard to estimate |
|  | LT and high-risk projects get a pessimistic NPV |
|  | Strategic importance is not captured |
