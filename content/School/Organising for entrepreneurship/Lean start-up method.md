Presence/absence of [[Absorptive capacity]] or [[Absorptive capacity|ACAP]] is crucial for being successful as a [[Start-up]].

The three key principles of the Lean start-up method:
1. Create a series of hyptoheses/assumptions
2. MVP (prototype) [[Methods to test hypotheses|to test these hypotheses]]
3. Approach based on [[BML-cycle|BML-cycles]].

Point 3. requires a big focus on feedback. Often they're scared to show the current state of the product. This approach is a stealth mode for start-up entrepreneurs.

## Other important factors
### Crossing the chasm
Moore (Moore, 1991) found that most products can't cross the chasm and get stuck at the early adobpters, instead of getting attention from the main stream market.

There should be a focus on creation of firm value over time. During the [[Bootstrapping period]] you should focus to push forward the product to the mainstream market.

### Need for prior market knowledge
Having prior experience for the market that you will enter in, can have a positive influence on the implementation of learned stuff in the [[BML-cycle]]. Prior market knowledge will also benefit the [[Absorptive capacity|ACAP]] of the [[Start-up]].
