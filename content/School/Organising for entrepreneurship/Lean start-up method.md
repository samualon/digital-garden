# Core principles
Presence/absence of [[Absorptive capacity]] or [[Absorptive capacity|ACAP]] is crucial for being successful as a [[Start-up]].

The three key principles of the Lean start-up method (see [[Why the lean start-up changes everything by Blank#The lean start-up method|Article by Blank]]):
1. Create a series of hyptoheses/assumptions
2. [[Minimum viable product]] (MVP / prototype) [[Methods to test hypotheses|to test these hypotheses]]
3. Approach based on [[BML-cycle|BML-cycles]].

Point 3. requires a big focus on feedback. Companies in *stealth mode* (see [[Why the lean start-up changes everything by Blank#The lean start-up method|Article by Blank]]) will be scared to ask for feedback, since it reveals their plans.
# Other important factors
## Crossing the chasm
A research by Moore (Moore, 1991) found that most products can't cross the chasm and get stuck at the early adopters, instead of getting attention from the main stream market.

There should be a focus on creation of firm value over time. During the [[Bootstrapping period]] you should focus to push forward the product to the mainstream market by turning your business in a concrete solution.

## Need for prior market knowledge
Having prior experience for the market that you will enter in (or overall market knowledge), can have a positive influence on the implementation of learned stuff in the [[BML-cycle]]. Prior market knowledge will also benefit the [[Absorptive capacity|ACAP]] of the [[Start-up]].
