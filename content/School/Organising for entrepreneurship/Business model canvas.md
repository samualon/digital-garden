![[Business model canvas.png]]
The business model canvas is a template created by [[Alexander Osterwalder]]. It allows to develop a new [[Business model]] or to describe existing ones.
# Components
| Component | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| *Key partners* | Outlines the network of suppliers and external partners that make the business model work |
| *Key activities* | Describes the most important things a company must perform to make its business model work |
| *Key resources* | Describes the most important assets required to make a business model work |
| *[[Value proposition]]* | What do we offer to customers? Describes the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific customer segment. |
| *Cost structure* | Describes all costs incurred to operate a business model |
| *Customer relationships* | Describes how an organization gets, keeps, and grows each customer segment and what type of relationships it entertains with each of them |
| *Channels* | Outlines the customer touch points through which an organization interacts with each of its customer segments to communicate and deliver a value proposition |
| *Customer segments* | Who are your target customers? The different groups of people or organizations your organization aims to help. Which customer segments are relevant for you? |
| *Revenue streams* | Represents the type of revenues an organization generates from each customer segment for a specific value proposition |
For each of these components we can [[Business model canvas questions|ask questions to assess them]].
# Front- and back-stage
On the right-hand side you can find all the front-stage factors (the desirability). On the left-hand side you can find the back-stage factors (the feasibility).
# Feasibility, Desirability, Viability
The [[Business model canvas]] can be divided into three main groups:

| Group | Description | Components |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Feasibility | Can we build it? | Key partners, activities, resources. |
| Desirability | Do they want it? | Value proposition, customer relationships, segments and channels. |
| Viability | Sanity check | Cost structure and revenue streams |
# Real world examples
Some real world examples that successfully applied the [[Business model canvas]] are:
- Nespresso
- Apple

They showed three important lessons:
1. Focus on the product through the business model. No a focus on product innovation alone.
2. Invent a new business model, don't just copy competitors.
3. No certainty from before if it would work, had to **take risk and experiment**.
