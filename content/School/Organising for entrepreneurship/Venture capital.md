# Functioning
A VC will pool money from different big investors and invest it through a VC fund in a selected group of ventures, hoping to have at least one home run.

The activities run through a cycle:
1. Investors invest in the fund
2. VC selects and invests in companies for 5 to 10 years
3. Return in the form of cash of shares to the investors
4. Back to step 1.

# Expectations
Venture capital firms demand two things from firms:
1. Equity
2. Board of director seats

They will eventually require an exit (after 5-7 years)

Expect 5-10X growth in value of successful invested company, or 40% - 60%. They will typically provide USD 1 mio.
# Screening and due diligence
VC's will intensively evaluate potential investment before deciding to invest. They run through a linear process where they could potentially drop the investment at every step:

Most ventures don't make it through this process. Of all the submitted investments, less than 5% are accepted and executed.
## Board of directors
They will do X things:
1. Monitor
2. Make strategic decisions
