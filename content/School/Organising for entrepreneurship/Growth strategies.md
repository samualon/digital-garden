## Internal
### New product development
A company increases revenues and profits by creating and selling new products or services. Typical for fast-paced industries (electronica, pharma, etc.).

This carries high risk as a new business model is required.
### Improving
Three options:
- Improving an existing product or service
- Increasing [[Market penetration]]
- Extending product lines (creating variations of products)
### International expansion
[[International expansion]] entails using new activities outside of the home country to increase company growth.
## External
### Mergers and acquisitions
The firm grows by purchasing other firms or merging with another firm. This allows for pooling of interests and resources.
### Licensing
Licensing involves granting another company the right to use [[Intellectual property right|IP]] under clearly defined conditions.
### Strategic alliances and Joint-ventures
#### Strategic alliance
A [[Strategic alliance]] is a partnership between two firms to achieve a common goal. Two types:
- [[Technological alliance]]
- [[Marketing alliance]]
#### Joint-venture
Two or more firms create a new entity that pools a part of their resources which creates a new jointly owned organization.

A motivation for this is often gaining access to a foreign market.
