Founded by Russian baker Marina Martianova, Candice Cake is a cake-producing companies that are low-calorie, low-sugar and organicaly homemade.

After growing in Russia, Marina decided to enter the US market, but this brought several challenges and important decissions.
## Challenges for entering in the US
- No network in the US yet
- Potential competition
- Different entry modes
- Potential different customer preferences
- Different institutional environment
- No geographical proximity
## Entry modes
### Wholly-owned subsidiaries (B2C)
#### Advantages
- High control (on customer journey)
- Possibility to scale it up to a franchising model if successful
- Gather lots of data from customer, this allows you to utilize the [[Lean start-up method]]. This counters many of the [[Candice Cake#Challenges for entering in the US|challenges mentioned earlier]].
#### Disadvantages
- Need for lots of resources
### Selling to retailers (B2B)
#### Advantages
- Infrastructures are already in place
- Established customer bases
#### Disadvantages
There is a certain cost to transfer knowledge to the distributor and control/follow-up the distributor's actions.
