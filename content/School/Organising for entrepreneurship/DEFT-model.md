The DEFT-model is a team composition model for [[Entrepreneurial teams]]. It consists of four basic principles:
1. **D**iversity, within teams
2. **E**xpertise, of team members
3. **F**aultlines, within teams
4. **T**iming, of team expansion
# Diversity
Two types of team diversity:
1. Knowledge diversity
2. Social diversity
## Knowledge diversity
This entails differences in:
- Functional areas
- Industry knowledge
- Work experience
- Education

Knowledge diversity is beneficial for:
- Innovation
- Creativity
- Flexibility
- Holism (intimate interconnections)
## Social diversity
This entails differences in:
- Ethnicity
- Gender
- Age
- Language

Social diversity can be detrimental when:
- stereotyping leads to conflicts.
- resolving conflicts has high opportunity costs.
# Expertise
## Increasing expertise
You should map the skills required for the venture and fill gaps between these requirements and the current team.

Three kinds of skill are important:
- Functional skills
- Industry skills
- Start-up skills
## Technical - inter-personal skills
Often people can have high expertise but low inter-personal skills[^1], or vise versa.

When task-interdependence[^2] is low, a lower amount of inter-personal skills isn't detrimental.

Analogue, when task interdependence is high, lower expertise isn't detrimental.
# Faultlines
Faultlines divide teams into subgroups based on attributes (f.e. gender). When different faultlines further divide different groups, a risk of the team falling apart is higher. ([Faultlines article](https://j-brucestewartphd.medium.com/faultline-theory-why-teams-fall-apart-4f80c5522420))
# Timing
You can hire when:
- you see a good fit
- You expect growth

Hiring earlier on has the benefit of growing a cohesive team, which spares money spent if you have to create this team later on.
