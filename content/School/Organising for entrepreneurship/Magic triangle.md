This represents the composition of a business model using the following three components:
1. [[Value-creation]]
2. [[Value-capturing]]
3. [[Value-delivery]]
# Value-creation and value-capturing
These two components have a special relationship as they define price, profit and customer surplus:

The value that is captured equals the cost of production minus the price charged, or the **profit**.

The value created is this profit plus the customer surplus, as you'll often create more value than you capture (unless you can charge max willingness to pay).
