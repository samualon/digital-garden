## Introduction
Traditionally, startups went through the following process:
1. Write [[Business plan]]
2. Pitch to investors
3. Assemble team
4. Introduce product
5. Maximize sales

Until they eventually suffer a fatal setback. 75% of [[Start-up]]s fail.

A new process that decreases risk of failure emerged, the [[Lean start-up method]]. It differs from tradition

| Traditional | [[Lean start-up method]] |
| ---- | ---- |
| Planning | Experimenting |
| Intuition | Customer feedback |
| Big design upfront | Iterative design |
The idea is to fail fast and continuously learn.
## Fallacy of the perfect business plan
### Traditional business plan
Traditionally, every founder creates a full business plan including a five year forecast. They spend hours developing a product without any customer input. Eventually, when the product comes to market, they realize customers have no demand for the functionality.

We learned three things over time:
1. Business plans rarely survive first contact with customers
2. No-one requires an extremely uncertain five year financial forecast
3. Startups don't unfold using a *master plan*, like a big corporation.
### The lean start-up method
A temporary organization designed to search for a scalable business model.

Three key principles:
1. Summarize founder hypotheses in a [[Business model canvas]].
2. *Get out of the building* or [[Customer development]] 
3. Practice [[Agile development]]
