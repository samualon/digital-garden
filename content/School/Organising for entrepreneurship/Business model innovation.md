# Introductory case of Nokia
[[Nokia]] was a major phone seller before the millennium change. Their phones were durable and cheap.

After the millennium change, a lot of phone manufacturers started innovating new technology for phones (f.e. Motorola, Blackberry, etc.). Nokia failed to adopt to this changing environment, which eventually leaded to their downfall.
## Key takeaways
- Your business model should adopt to changing environments, it shouldn't be carved in stone.
- Past success is no longer a guarantee for survival.

Today, a company's long-term competitiveness depends on its ability to innovate its business model. How can they do this?

## Business model
A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. This is called the [[Magic triangle]].
## Business model innovation
Innovation entails an invention AND a commercialization of this invention.

Business model innovation differs from simply innovating a product or a process by the fact that at least two of the four components of the [[Magic triangle]] are affected.
### Strategy innovation
There are many different possible [[Business model strategies]]. These base strategies can be used in different way to innovate the business model of your company.

# Business model canvas
You can use the [[Business model canvas]] to describe your business model, create a business model or get a view on how you could change your existing business model to better fit the changing environment.
# Uncertainty in business model innovation

A business model might look good on paper, but it's still a bunch of hypotheses and guesses.

By creating three layers to our [[Business model canvas]], we can test it:
1. **Business model layer**: build your best possible business model.
2. **Hypothesis layer**: outlines the assumptions on which the business model layer is built.
3. **Test layer**: set of test for each of the assumptions from the hypothesis layer. Allows us to verify these assumptions.
