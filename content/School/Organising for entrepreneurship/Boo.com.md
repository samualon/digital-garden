Boo.com was a [[Start-up]]  online shop with a high growth ambition. From the start they had a world-wide market orientation, which is why they required $ 185 million to start up. Eventually the firm got liquidated after only 18 months.

## How investors got attracted to the start-up
Several factors attracted the attention of investors:
- The founders were serial entrepreneurs, they built the third-biggest online bookstore. Afterwards they realized an exit with this company.
- They charged full retail prices instead of cut-rate prices that competitors charged. This resulted in a high profit margin of 55%.
- They prioritized a high [[Value proposition]]. They offered 360Â° views of all articles. The goal was to offer a fully online shopping experience.
- The site was accessible via the internet, so there was a lot of potential for global growth.

## The problems that Boo.com encountered
### Technical difficulty
A lot of complex features had to be linked together to create a perfect customer experience. They underestimated how difficult this would be, which caused a first postponement of the launch. 

The site also required high internet access, which only 2% of their customers had. This was a [[Complementary asset]].

### Business model adjustments
This poor initial performance forced them to adjust their [[Business model]], but the adjustments they made missed the crucial problems that needed solving.

### Lack of financial discipline
- Employees traveled first class
- Employees stayed in 5 star hotels
- Etc

### Problematic market launch
They launched everything in 18 countries from the start. The problems with this are:
- Language problems
- They needed a lot of offices in all these companies
- Need for all the different currencies

They should've:
1. tested the product first with the target audience.
2. managed the geographical expansion.
3. thought more carefully about expertise.

These three factors would've increased the chance of success. These relate strongly to the [[Lean start-up method]].
