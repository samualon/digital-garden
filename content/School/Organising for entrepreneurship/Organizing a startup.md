# From value chain to value network
In the past, there mostly existed pipeline-like companies that think in terms of an [[Value chain]]. 

Now there is a shift towards more platform-like companies that try to connect producers and consumers. These companies think more towards [[Value network]] thinking. 

The transformation form [[Value chain]] to [[Value network]] consists of three aspects:
1. From resource control to resource orchestration
2. From internal optimization to external interaction.
3. From a focus on customer value to a focus on network value.
