# Content
This paper describes patterns of competitive interactions between startups and incumbents in an innovation context.
## Competition versus cooperation
When [[Intellectual property right]] is strong and specialized [[Complementary asset]]s are held by the incumbent, it is beneficial for startups to cooperate with the incumbent. In this case, the technological leadership stays with the big firm.

When [[Intellectual property right]] is weak and there's a low barrier of entry (see [[Porter's five forces]]), it is beneficial for startups to competitively commercialize the idea and in this way exploit the blind spots of the incumbent. In this case, technological leadership can shift.
## IP and market for ideas
Beside serving as a protection of knowledge, IP is a way for incumbents to increase the creation of markets for ideas. This way, the incumbent can *tap into the high-powered incentives, creativity and flexibility* of startups that cooperate (see [[#Competition versus cooperation]]). This may allow for an increase in resources devoted to innovation, which helps the incumbent as well as entrepreneurs.
## Implications for strategic management
Strategic management should focus on innovation that is radical in an organizational and market sense. This way, it forms a competitive threat to the incumbent and not just an enhancement of their competitive position (see [[#Competition versus cooperation]]).
