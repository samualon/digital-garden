![[Funding rounds.png]]

Often funding will happen in several rounds. 
1. Start-up round
2. 1st round or [[Serie A]]
3. 2nd round or [[Serie B]]

Mostly only [[Business angel]]s will invest in the first round, in the second round a combination of [[Business angel]]s and [[Venture capital|venture capitalist]]s is typical.

The 1st round is situated between the first prototype and the first production model. After the first production model is made, the second round will happen.
