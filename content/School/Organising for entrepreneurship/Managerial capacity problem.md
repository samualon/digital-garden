A growing firm requires two services:
1. **Entrepreneurial services**: generating of new market, product and service ideas.
2. **Managerial services**: routine functions that facilitate successful execution of opportunities generated by **Entrepreneurial services**.

Several factors might prevent a growth in managerial service capacity:
- Hiring more employees is expensive
- New hires need a lot of time to adapt to the business culture
- New hires need a lot of time to acquire firm-specific skills

The [[Managerial capacity problem]] can be seen as a bottleneck that occurs when difficulties in managerial capacity prevent the company from taking advantage of new opportunities.
