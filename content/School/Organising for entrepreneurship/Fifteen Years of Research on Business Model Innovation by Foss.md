**Title**: Fifteen Years of Research on Business Model Innovation: How Far Have We Come, and Where Should We Go?
**Author**: [[Nicolai J. Foss]]
**Year**: 2016
**Research question**: How far has research on BMI come?
# Abstract
[[Business model innovation]] has gained a lot of attention in the last decades, but literature lacks theoretical underpinning and empirical inquiry is not cumulative.

The paper identified and analyzed 150 scholarly articles on BMI published between 2000 and 2015. They assessed research efforts and suggestions for future research.

Foss concludes that literature doesn't have construct clarity and has gaps in terms of:
- antecedent conditions
- contingencies
- outcomes
# Content
The research found that the literature around business models and [[Business model innovation]] lacked anchoring to particular management fields.

The research found two major problems with BM and BMI literature:
- Ambiguity
- Four separate streams of BMI research
## Ambiguity
Over the years, many different definitions of business model innovation have been adopted (see Table 3  in attachment below). This shows a clear ambiguity around the concept.
## Four streams of BMI research
The research found four seperate research streams of BMI that don't support or build upon each other:

| Focus | Method |
| ---- | ---- |
| *Conceptualization and classification of BMI* | Conceptual, case studies, surveys |
| *BMI as a process (importance of leadership and learning)* | Conceptual, case studies, content analysis, experimental |
| *BMI as an outcome (describing BMI's)* | Case studies |
| *BMI and the organizational* | Surveys |
## Conclusion
To advance BMI literature, a conceptualization of BMI that uses innovation and complex systems literature should be created.

Additionally, a more direct focus to managerial challenges of BMI is needed.
# Discussion
## Business models
### Definition
> *"The architecture of a firm's mechanisms to create, deliver and capture value."*
### Business model research
Three streams of business model research:
1. BM for enterprise classification
2. BM as antecedent for differences in enterprise performance
3. BM as a potential unit of innovation
## Business model innovation
### Definition
> *"... designed, novel, and nontrivial changes to the key elements of a firmâ€™s BM and/or the architecture linking these elements."*
### Business model innovation research
Four streams of [[Business model innovation]] research:
1. Conceptualizing BMI
2. BMI as an organizational change process
3. BMI as an outcome
4. Consequences of BMI
