aliases:
  - EMH

The efficient market hypothesis entails a market where security prices reflect all available information. *There is no $\alpha$.* 

The market is said to be efficient with respect to an information set $\phi$. When revealing information $\phi$, security prices should be unaffected. There is thus no way of making profit by trading on the basis of $\phi$.
# Implications
1. News about future performance is instantly incorporated into stock prices.
2. Since this news is unpredictable, stock prices also are unpredictable.
3. Only by taking risk, you can gain a return above $R_f$. Without taking risk there's no way to gain returns, so there's no $\alpha$.
# Types of EMH
- [[Weak-form efficiency]]
- [[Semi-strong-form efficiency]]
- [[Strong-form efficiency]]
# Empirical evidence
Two types of results:
- [[Momentum]], or positive serial correlation.
- [[Reversal]], or negative serial correlation.
## Weak-form efficiency
**In the short term**, evidence for [[Momentum]]. This is because of overreaction to positive returns.

**In the long term**, evidence for [[Reversal]]. This is because in the long term, the overreaction of the short term gets corrected.
### Violation of EMH?
[[#Weak-form efficiency|Above findings]] don't have to mean a violation of EMH if:
- [[Momentum]] carries risk.
- [[Reversal]] is the correction of a temporary increase/decrease of the risk-premium.
## Semi-strong-form efficiency
Tests for this version of EMH use *fundamental analysis* using indicators such as:
- [[Dividend yield effect]]
- [[PE-effect]]
- [[Neglected firm effect]]
- [[Liquidity effect]]
- [[BM-effect]]
- [[Small firm effect]]
## Rational and behavior debate
Since there's no way of knowing the fundamental price of an asset, it's impossible to assess if an asset is over- or under-priced.

Two camps exist in this debate:
- **Rational camp**: CAPM is not a correct benchmark, there are uncaptured risk factors.
- **Behavioral camp**: CAPM is the correct benchmark.
### Behavioral camp
The behavioral camp believes many investors don't invest rationally by:
- Using **heuristics** to make decisions, and thus not processing all information correctly.
- **Using behavioral biases** to make decisions.
#### Relevance
Many investors believe that there are behavioral investors, but that this portion is too small to have an impact.

Besides, exploiting this irrationality in the form of arbitrage is limited due to:
- **Fundamental risk**: exploiting a mispricing is costly and risky.
- **Implementing costs**: much capital is needed to exploit mispricing, and lots of transaction costs occur.
- **Model risk**: since fundamental value is unknown, the investor has to rely on their own pricing model, which could be false.
- **Law of one price**: since prices are often not perfectly competitive, arbitrage is limited.

Two main arguments contra:
- Arbitrage opportunities exist, but are often very small.
- Successful arbitrage exploitation strategies are kept secret.

Two main arguments pro:
- Unsuccessful strategies are stopped.
- After the fact, analysis always shows outperforming strategies.
# Active and passive investing
Active investors reject EMH, as they believe they can do research to find market inefficiencies.

Passive investors accept EMH, as they don't believe in inefficiencies and only trade by mimicking indices.
## Empirical evidence
Evidence shows that on average, indices beat active investors by aprox. 1%. Furthermore, 30 out of 50 years indices outperform.

Two nuances:
- Active funds have costs, without costs they could beat the market.
- Skilled fund managers can consistently outperform.
