Passive bond management takes price as given and just tries to reduce associated risk.

Two main strategies exist:
1. Indexing strategy
2. Immunization strategy
# Indexing strategy
In an indexing strategy, the investor tries to replicate a [[Bond index]], using a risk profile in line with the risk profile of the index.

Fully replicating a [[Bond index]] is difficult:
- Due to maturing of bonds, constant rebalancing is required.
- Due to high intermediary incomes (coupons), reinvestment is required.

An investor will thus restrict its portfolio to the representative bonds by using [[Bond stratification]].
# Immunization strategy
Immunization tries to insulate the portfolio against intrest rate risk by matching duration of assets and liabilities. This way intrest rate risk of the liabilities is compensated by the higher reinvestment income of the assets.

This is often done by banks.
## Cash-flow matching
Since maturities and big intrest rate changes still can unbalance the immunization, constant re-balancing is required, which makes the *passive investing* more active. This is quite time-intensive.

Cash-flow matching offers a way of making this process less time-intensive.
