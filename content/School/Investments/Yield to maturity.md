Corresponds to the [[Internal rate of return]] of a bond. It describes the total anticipated return of a bond if it was held until maturity, with all intern payments reinvested at the same rate.

It is calculated by using the [[Bond pricing|pricing formula of a bond]] and replacing the intrest rate with rate $Y$:
$$ P_{0,t} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{C_t}{(1+ YÂ¸{0,t})^t} + \frac{par \: value}{(1+Y_{0,T})^T} $$
## Zero-coupon bond
A [[Zero-coupon bond]] [[Yield to maturity|YTM]] is calculated as follows:
$$ P_{0,T} = (\frac{1}{1+ Y_{0,T}})^T$$
