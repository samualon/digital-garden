When using this method to compare investments, we cancel out risk so we can compare investments on their return only.

There are two common approaches:
- Group investments by risk-category and compare returns inside each category.
- Use a risk-reward measure, which calculates the extra returns for a unit of risk. There are two popular reward-to-risk measures:
	- [[Sharpe ratio]]
	- [[Sortino Ratio]]
