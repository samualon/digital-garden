NAV is used to value varius assets, such as [[Investment fund]].

$$ 
NAV = \frac{market\:value\:of\:assets - liabilities}{shares\:outstanding} 
$$
# Front-end load
The front-end load is a fee when buying into an [[Investment fund]]. The offering price of the fund then deviates from the NAV and can be calculated as follows:
$$ Offering \: price = \frac{NAV}{1- (Front-end \: load)} $$
