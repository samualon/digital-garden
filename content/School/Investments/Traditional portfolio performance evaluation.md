To evaluate the performance of an existing portfolio, we have two important aspects:
1. Average return
2. Risk correction
# Average return
Two obvious averages of returns:
- [[Arithmetic average of returns]]
- [[Geometric average of returns]]

These two metrics don't account for impact of cash in- and outflows. A possible solution is the [[Dollar-weighted rate of return]]. It accounts for the amount of cash when investing.
## Best option
When comparing different investments/investors, a [[Geometric average of returns]] is more appropriate, since amount invested isn't relevant.

When assessing an individual investor, cash flow does matter, so we should use the [[Dollar-weighted rate of return]].
# Risk correction
Two approaches:
1. **Comparison universe**: categorize investments conform risk and compare only within categories.
2. [[Risk-adjusted performance measures]]
