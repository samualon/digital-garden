# Costs
The investment policy and and strategy have an impact on the [[Expense ratio]] of the fund, since actively managed funds will incur more costs.

Besides investment expenses, such as administration, brokerage costs and front- or back-end load are also possible costs. Because of all these different costs, cost transparency is highly regulated.
# Investment policies
Funds need to communicate about:
- objectives
- strategies
- carried risk
- past performance
- distribution policy
- fees and expenses

This information is delivered to investors using a [[prospectus]].

In the [[European Union|EU]], [[Investment fund|investment funds]] need to publish a [[Key Investor Information Document]] or [[Key Investor Information Document|KIID]].
