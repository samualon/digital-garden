A [[Synthetic CDO]] is a combination of a [[Traditional CDO]] and a [[Credit default swap|CDS]]. The Special Purpose Vehicle offers the buyer compensation in case of credit events instead of a cash amount (like in a [[Credit default swap|CDS]]) and it also makes the assets tradeable for the sellers.
