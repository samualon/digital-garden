Three categories exist:
1. Absolute performance measures
2. Relative performance measures
3. Industry fund rating systems
# Absolute performance measures
Here, investments are compared individually against each other. Examples:
- [[Sharpe ratio]]
- [[Roy ratio]]
- [[Revised Sharpe ratio]]
- [[Adjusted Sharpe ratio]]
- [[MAD ratio]]
- [[MÂ² ratio]]

These all allow to rank portfolios, but doesn't quantify the size of their performance. Although, the [[Sharpe ratio]] of a passive investment portfolio can be used as a benchmark.
# Relative performance measures
Two important metrics:
- [[Information ratio]]
- [[Treynor ratio]]

$\alpha$'s alone can't be used since higher $\alpha$'s are more attractive, but they come with more risk.
