Investments are generally measured in two dimensions:
- Measure of return
- Measure of risk

There is not one perfect measurement, but you should be consistent when measuring across investments and over time.

To assess how much return is expected for a certain amount of risk, you can use [[Risk-adjusted returns]] to compare investments.
