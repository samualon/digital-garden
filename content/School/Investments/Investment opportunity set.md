An investment opportunity set is a combination of risky as well as risk-free assets which make up a complete portfolio.
## Portfolio with 1 risky and 1 risk-free asset
The risk-free asset (f.e. T-bonds) is denoted as $F$, its returns as $R_F$. and its level of risk as $\sigma_F$.  The risky asset (f.e. a portfolio of stocks and ETF's) is denoted as $P$, its returns as $R_P$. and its level of risk as $\sigma_P$. 

$y$ is the fraction of the portfolio that is invested in $P$ and $(1-y)$ the fraction in $F$.
### Return $R_C$ of $C$
The complete portfolio $C$ has the following return $R_C$:
$$ R_C =  yR_P + (1-y)R_F $$
$$ R_C = R_F + y(R_P + R_F) $$
### Expected return $E(R_C)$ of $C$
$$ (1)\: E(R_C) = R_F + y(E(R_P)+R_F) $$
with risk 
$$\sigma_C = y\sigma_P \Leftrightarrow (2) \: y = \frac{\sigma_C}{\sigma_P}$$
Combining equation $(1)$ and $(2)$ results in the [[Capital allocation line]].
