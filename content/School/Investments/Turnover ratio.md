  - Turnover rate
---
The [[Turnover ratio]] describes how many of the assets of a fund have been replaced over a time period (usually one year).
$$ Turnover\:rate = \frac{market\:value\:of\:assets\:sold}{market\:value\:of\:assets} $$
A fund that very active fund will thus have a higher [[Turnover ratio|Turnover rate]] than a more passive fund, since more assets get replaced each year.
# Transaction costs
Since a fund with a high [[Turnover ratio]] will buy and sell a lot of stocks, their transaction costs will usually be high.
