In the [[Expectations hypothesis]], investors believe that the [[Forward rate]]s are the expected rates:
$$ F_{T,1} = E(R_{T,1}) $$
Thus:
$$ (1+E(R_{T,1})) = \frac{(1+Y_{O,T+1})^{T+1}}{(1+ Y_{0,T})^T} $$
In this view, an upward sloping yield curve means rising future expected [[Short rate]]s.

As apposed to investors in the [[Liquidity preference theory]], these investors don't believe in risk and take the [[Forward rate]]s as expected rates.
