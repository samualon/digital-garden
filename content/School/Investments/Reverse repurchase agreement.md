# Example
*For market participants A and B:

A reverse repo allows Financial Institution A to earn interest on its excess funds by temporarily lending them to Market Participant B, who, in turn, uses the funds for short-term financing needs. The collateral provides security for Financial Institution A in case Market Participant B cannot repurchase the collateral on the agreed-upon date. Reverse repos are commonly used in the money markets as a means of short-term borrowing and lending between financial institutions.
