Allows retail investors to invest for a share in a pool of assets. 

By pooling assets, investors realize [[Economies of scale]]. These [[Economies of scale]] are achieved by:
- Diversification
- Divisibility
- Lower transaction costs
- Professional management
- Cheap record keeping and administration

Investment funds get valued using the [[Net asset value]] or [[Net asset value|NAV]].

If the composition of a fund is changed, we can calculate the [[Turnover ratio]] to get an idea of how many of the assets of the fund were changed/traded.

There are different types of funds:
- [[Open-end fund]] or [[Open-end fund|Mutual fund]]
- [[Closed-end fund]]
- [[Unit trust]]
- [[Exchange-traded fund]] or [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]]
- [[Commingled fund]]
- [[Real estate investment trust]] or [[Real estate investment trust|REIT]]
- [[Hedge fund]]
