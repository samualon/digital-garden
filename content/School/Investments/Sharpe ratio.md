The Sharpe ratio is the most wide spread reward-to-risk ratio. It is calculated as followed:
$$SR = \frac{E(R) - R_f}{\sigma} = \frac{E(R^e)}{\sigma}$$
with:
- $R^e = R - R_f$
- $E(R^e) = risk \: premium$

There is [[Sharpe ratio proof of different investment horizons|proof that you can't compare the Sharpe ratio for two investments with a different investing horizon]].
## Interpretation
The SR measures the additional returns for one more unit of risk. The higher the SR, the more reward per unit of risk.
