By combining the [[Capital allocation line]] and the [[Risk in investing#Utility and expected returns|formula for utility given a risk and expected return]] we can define an optimal investment where the graph of the [[Capital allocation line|CAL]] and the utility function touch.

## Mathematics
The investor wants to maximize his utility $U$ by choosing an optimal $y^*$:
$$ max \: U = E(R_C) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma²_C$$
When substituting $E(R_C)$ with the [[Investment opportunity set#Expected return $E(R_C)$ of $C$|formula for the expected return of a portfolio of a risky and risk-free asset]] and substituting $\sigma_C$ for $y \: * \: \sigma_P$ we get:
$$ max \: U = R_F + y (E(R_P) - R_F) - \frac{1}{2} Ay^2\sigma²_P $$
Using the first-order condition, we can then derive the optimal combination $y^*$:
$$ y^* = \frac{E(R_P) - R_F}{A\sigma²_P} $$
$y^*$ is thus directly proportional to the risk premium $E(R_P) - R_F$ of the asset.
