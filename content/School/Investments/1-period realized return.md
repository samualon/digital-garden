1-period realized return allows us to compare bonds with different maturities. We compare how much return we get if we held both bonds for only one time period.

When we buy the bond at time $t$, the formula is as follows:
$$ 1 + R_{t,1} = \frac{P_{t+1,T-1}}{P_{t,T}} = \frac{(1+Y_{t,T})^T}{(1+Y_{t+1,T-1})^{T-1}} $$
