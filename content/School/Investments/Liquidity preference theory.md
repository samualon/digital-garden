These investors assume that there's risk involved in bond investing:
- A long-term investor sees risk in having to *roll over* short term bonds to have his long term investment.
- A short-term investor sees risk in having to sell a long term bond to have his short term investment.

They don't assume that [[Forward rate]]s are equal to the expected future rates, as opposed to the [[Expectations hypothesis]]. They see a [[Forward rate]] as follows:
$$ F_{T,1} = E(R_{T,1}) + risk \: premium $$
Thus:
$$ (1+E(R_{T,1})+ risk \: premium) = \frac{(1+Y_{O,T+1})^{T+1}}{(1+ Y_{0,T})^T} $$
The risk premium is positively correlated to the amount of short-term investors and negatively correlated to the amount of long-term investors.

According to the [[Liquidity preference theory]], the market is dominated by short-term investors, thus **the risk premium is positive**.
