A market-weighted index will weigh every asset according to its market capitalization.

The weight of an asset $n$ in an index with $N$ assets is calculated as follows:
$$ 
w_n = \frac{MC_n}{MC_1 + MC_2 \:+ \: ... \: + \:MC_N}
$$
with $MC_n = P_n * stocks \: outstanding$.

Contrary to a [[Price-weighted index]], a market-weighted index is not influenced by [[stock splits]].
## In practice
Since not all shares of a company are traded (f.e. shares holded by the CEO of the company) they are corrected for this free-float.
