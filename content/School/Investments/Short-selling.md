A short-sell is a negative weight on a risky asset in an [[Investment portfolio]]. The investor borrows a risky asset from the borrower and immediately sells it. He eventually will buy back the asset (ideally when the asset is cheaper) and return it to the borrower. This way the investor can profit from a decrease in the price of a risky asset.
## Short-selling in practice
The investor will borrow a risky asset from a broker and sell it. The proceeds of the short sale will go into a margin account. If the price of the asset increases, the investor will be asked to post margin to cover for losses. Eventually, the investor will buy the asset and give it back to the broker
## Negative connotation
Since going short has a negative connotation, regulators sometimes ban it in times of economic distress. The motivation for this is that short-sellers speculate on the downfall of companies and the economy.

This regulatory intervention could be a bad thing since bad news should be reflected in the price of a stock, but this is inhibited when short-selling is banned.
