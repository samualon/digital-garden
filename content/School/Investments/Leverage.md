Leverage is a negative weight on a [[Money market instrument]] in an [[Investment portfolio]]. When using leverage, you borrow money now, invest in a risky investment and commit to pay back the loan in the future. This way you're able to leverage your position on an investment and elevate your profits (or loses) on the returns of this asset. 
## Leverage in practice
In practice, you'll borrow money to invest in a risky asset. The portion of the value of the asset that originates from the borrower is called the **margin** (f.e. 50% of the assets value comes from the bank, which is a margin of 50%). 

When this margin falls below a certain **maintenance margin**, additional margin needs to be posted to get back to the maintenance margin. If the investor is unable to post this margin, the borrower will reduce the position such that the margin gets back to maintenance level.
