An investment portfolio is an investment in multiple assets at once. The return of the portfolio is measured using a weighted average of all the returns of the assets. This weight, $w_n$, represents the fraction of the value of the asset $n$ in the portfolios total value:
$$ R_{p,t} = \sum^N_{n=1}w_n R_{n,t}$$
## Negative weights
Weights are often positive, but can be negative in two cases:
1. [[Leverage]]
2. [[Short-selling]]

## Constructing a portfolio
There are two main choices that have to be made during a [[Capital allocation decission]]:
1. Choice between all risky investment opportunities.
2. Choice between the risky portfolio and risk-free investments.
### Choice between risky investments
Here we choose in which risky assets and what proportions we invest, we create an [[Investment opportunity set]]. This part of the portfolio is driven by diversification benefits and in **inefficient markets selection skills**.
### Choice between risky and risk-free investments
Here we choose which proportion of our wealth that we'll invest in risky assets and which proportion we'll invest in risk-free assets. This is driven by our [[Risk aversion]].
