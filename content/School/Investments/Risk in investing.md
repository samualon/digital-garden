## Risk and utility
### Utility and wealth
Since people want to optimize utility instead of wealth and utility isn't a linear function, we can't assume that our expected wealth is proportional to an increased amount of risk.

It is believed that utility has a logarithmic relation, which implies that someone who is poor will have a lot more utility from $100 than someone who is extremely rich. This log relationship of wealth and utility is characterized using the [[Log utility function]]. This is why risk-averse investors will sometimes reject fair or games or worse.
### Utility and expected returns
The following function explains how severely risk should be penalized, according to the level of [[Risk-aversion]] of the person:
$$ U = E(R) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigmaÂ² $$
This implicates four things:
- Higher expected returns result in higher utility.
- Higher risk results in lower utility.
- A high aversion to risk $A$ results in a higher risk-penalization.
- A lower aversion to risk $A$ results in a lower risk penalization.

Economics agree that a risk aversion $1<A<10$ is realistic.
