The Sortino ratio is an asymmetric alternative to the [[Sharpe ratio]]. It is calculated as follows:
$$ SR = \frac{E(R) - R_f}{LSPD}$$
with $LSPD$ being the lower partial standard deviation. In other words, the $LPSD$ is the standard deviation of returns lower than a chosen benchmark (often the risk-free rate).
